- Bring over gameframework code i still like.
	- fileio (some)
	- graphics (some)

- Add Remotery as git submodule as it cant be included as conan dependancies as it is too custom and or tools.

- Paths
	- Add GUID generation functionality to the project.
	- Investigate a way to not have paths used at runtime.

- Event System
	- Define event manager class Header functionality.
	- Define event data layout and API.
	- Implement the Event base structure.
	- Implement the event manager.

- Look at other gameframework code i could bring over with a rethink
	- eventmanager
	- scripting
	- resourcecache
	- graphics
	- shaders
	- physics
	- sound
	- memory

- List 3rd party libs i want to research including
	- bullet
	- lua
	- luabridge
	- openal
	- (or) SoLoud
	- imgui
	- whereami
	- convertutf
	- gliml
	- unittest++
	- libcurl
	- stb headers
	- enkiTS
	- imguizmo
	- tinycthread
	- clReflect

- List goals of the codebase
	- Desktop only. Run equally as well on OSX and Windows.
	- Simplicity.
	- Performance. Data orientated priority 1.
	- Integrates with minimal and useful 3rd party libs installed with conan package manager.
	- 3rd party Header files preferred, static libs at a stretch, no dynamic libs (except opengl).
	- 3rdParty libs hidden away behind abstractions, only called directly if they are understandable.
	- C/C++ but no exceptions, no deep object hierarchys in critical parts, minimal classes.

- List features i want and/or things i want to do:
	- In engine editor with imgui.
	- Reloading of assets and scripts without restart.
	- Lua scripting with standard lua lib only.
	- Coroutines and task orientated threading system.
	- Fully featured 3D math lib (add quaternions, raycasting)
	- Fast & performant opengl rendering.
	- Explore rendering and shader techniques.
	- Expose tools with ingame editor.
	- Write more tools in addition to glsl compiler.
	- Component based system.
