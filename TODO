- Research conan package manager.
[DONE]

- Research premake4.
[DONE]

- Add initial configs for these.
[DONE]

- Make simple demo opening a window & gl context.
	- Ability to clone and script installation of initial 3rd party dependancies.
	- premake scripts that generate xcode & VS project files.
	- minimal src added from gameframework.
	- demo app that opens a gl window with nothing in it.
[DONE]

- List 3rd party libs i want to include initially.
	- glfw?
	- sdl?
	- opengl

- List 3rd party libs i want to research including
	- bullet
	- lua
	- openal
	- (or) SoLoud
	- imgui
	- flextgl (instead of glew)
	- whereami
	- convertutf
	- gliml
	- Remotery
	- unittest++
	- libcurl
	- stb headers
	- enkiTS
	- imguizmo
	- tinycthread
	- clReflect

- List goals of the codebase
	- Desktop only. Run equally as well on OSX and Windows.
	- Simplicity.
	- Performance. Data orientated priority 1.
	- Integrates with minimal and useful 3rd party libs installed with conan package manager.
	- 3rd party Header files preferred, static libs at a stretch, no dynamic libs (except opengl).
	- 3rdParty libs hidden away behind abstractions, only called directly if they are understandable.
	- C/C++ but no exceptions, no deep object hierarchys in critical parts, minimal classes.

- List features i want and/or things i want to do:
	- In engine editor with imgui.
	- Reloading of assets and scripts without restart.
	- Lua scripting with standard lua lib only.
	- Coroutines and task orientated threading system.
	- Fully featured 3D math lib (add quaternions, raycasting)
	- Fast & performant opengl rendering.
	- Explore rendering and shader techniques.
	- Expose tools with ingame editor.
	- Write more tools in addition to glsl compiler.
	- Component based system.

- Bring over gameframework code i still like.
	- Math
	- premake scripts
	- fileio (some)
	- gamebase (some)
	- graphics (some)

- Look at other gameframework code i could bring over with a rethink
	- physics
	- graphics
	- eventmanager
	- scripting
	- resourcecache
	- sound
	- datastructures
	- memory
	- shaders
